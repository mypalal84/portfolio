I enjoyed working in a group environment.  We made a hiking themed website that gives the user a quiz complete with pictures to choose from.  Depending on what the user chooses throughout the quiz, a recommended hike result page is generated.<\/p>"

For this project, I was given 20 different product images, and told to make a market research test that would randomly show 3 at a time.  When a user selects and clicks on an image, the images are replaced with 3 different random images.  After 25 clicks, the study is over, and a chart appears complete with the data.  I also used local storage, so the data updates after each test until it is cleared from the browser.<\/p>"
